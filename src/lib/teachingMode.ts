IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY plain text. Do not use JSON, markdown formatting, code blocks, or any other structured format.

Please provide a brief teaching explanation that covers:
- Grammar structures and usage patterns
- Cultural context when relevant
- Practical usage tips
- Any interesting linguistic notes

Teaching Guidelines for ${difficulty} level:

General Guidelines:
- Keep explanations simple and encouraging (2-3 sentences)
- Focus on practical usage and real-world application
- Use positive, supportive language
- Make it appropriate for ${difficulty} level learners
